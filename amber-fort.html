            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Built in red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard. It consists of the Diwan-e-Aam (Hall of Public Audience), Diwan-e-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace), and Sukh Niwas.</p>
            
            <p>The fort was built with high-quality materials from many places. Marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan. The palace contains stunning pieces of mirrored glass imported from Belgium. Gardens were based upon the layout of the Mughal Gardens.</p>
            
            <p>During its peak, the palace was defended by the huge walls and series of gates and paths. The fort and its palace complex continue to stand as a proud reminder of the city's rich history and cultural heritage.</p>
